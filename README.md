# Artisanal Reskins: Bob's Assets

This mod provides icons and sprites to support reskinning items, technologies, and entities from
Bob's Mods.

## What is this?

This is a collection of images used by Artisanal Reskins and made available to mod authors as a
standalone mod. These asset mods provide icons and sprites with tint masks enabling mod authors to
add items, technologies, and entities with arbitrary colors. They are separate from Artisanal
Reskins, so that mod authors may use these assets in their mods more conveniently.

## Usage Guidance

It is intended that mod authors utilize Artisanal Reskins: Assets API to work with the icons and
sprite sets contained in the Artisanal Reskin asset mods, rather than working with the files and
methods directly.
